> [!NOTE]
> If using the MD770 RGB BT in bluetooth mode, you'll first need to turn on bluetooth using the single switch on the back of the right half. To operate in bluetooth mode, the battery needs to be charged.  The main controller and battery for your keyboard are in the right half. 

3. When you first turn your keyboard on, it will be in bluetooth mode.  When in bluetooth mode, the keyboard will charge off the usb port, but not act as a usb device.
4. To use the keyboard as a usb device, switch it to usb mode using `fn-2`.
