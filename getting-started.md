# This is the Mistel MD770 "Barrocco" manual that should exist but doesn't.

## holy crap I plugged it in and nothing works!

Your keyboard is in "bluetooth" mode. Hit Pn-2 to put it in USB mode and your computer should rcognize it as a usb device.

## how do I know its charged up?

Solid blue light on light #2

# I came back to my computer and my keyboard isn't working..
Press the right half of the keyboard is what powers it, so press a key on the right half to get it to turn back on.
